You can also view them in my wiki.

Which areas of Manhattan had the largest number of 311 noise complaints? What are some reasons you can think of for these trends?
  By looking at the Graduated map of noise complaints by NTA, those areas are Chinatown, Soho, and upper manhattan.
  The reason I believe that this trends are happening is because those areas have a lot of resident, in those areas there are a lot of residental buildings.
  With more people living in those areas, there could be much more noise complaints by just one loud music/party or other issues.
  
What are some trends you noticed regarding the descriptor for noise complaints?
  Some trends I noticed are there are more ice cream truck complaints happening in higher populated areas. Which I believe is a strategy those ice cream seller is using,
  which is sell more ice cream to the resident areas where the kids will be. I also noticed that there are more construction complaints in downtown manhattan and midtown
  manhattan, which is reasonable that those areas have a lot of new buildings happening.
  
How did the additional data and map changed or reinforced your insights from Q(1)?
  After I add the population data of Manhattan, it reinforced my insights from Q1. there are much residents in those areas and the upper manhattam areas seems to be the
  areas have the highest population density.
